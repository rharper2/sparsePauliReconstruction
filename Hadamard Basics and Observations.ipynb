    "### What's in a name?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of conventions as to where which qubit should be. Here we are going to adopt a least significant digit approach - which is different from the normal 'ket' approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example: $IZ$ means an $I$ 'Pauli' on qubit = 2 and a $Z$ 'Pauli' on qubit = 1 (indexing off 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays indexed starting with 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those less familiar with Julia, unlike - say - python all arrays and vectors are indexed off 1. Without going into the merits or otherwise of this, we just need to keep it in mind. With our bitstring the bitstring 0000 represents the two qubits $II$, it has value 0, but it will index the first value in our vector i.e. 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Paulis with bitstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to represent Paulis with bit strings, including for instance the convention used in **Improved Simulation of Stabilizer Circuits**, *Scott Aaronson and Daniel Gottesman*, [arXiv:quant-ph/0406196v5](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196v5).\n",
    "\n",

    "When transforming Pauli eigenvalue to the probability of a particular error occuring, there are distinct advantages in using the WHT_Pauli transform. The order of the Pauli errors and the order of the Pauli eigenvalues remains the same. However, most common packages (including the one we are going to use here in Julia) don't support this type of transform, rather they implement the WHT_natural transform. The WHT_natural transform also makes the peeling algorithm slightly less fiddly. **However** it does mean we need to be very careful about the order of things. If we use the WHT_natural transform then the following relationship holds - *note the indices (labels) of the Paulis in the probability vector*:\n",
