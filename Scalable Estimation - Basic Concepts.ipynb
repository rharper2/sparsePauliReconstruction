The order of the Pauli errors and the order of the Pauli eigenvalues remains the same. However, most common packages (including the one we are going to use here in Julia) don't support this type of transform, rather they implement the WHT_natural transform. The WHT_natural transform also makes the peeling algorithm slightly less fiddly. **However** it does mean we need to be very careful about the order of things. If we use the WHT_natural transform then the following relationship holds - *note the indices (labels) of the Paulis in the probability vector*:\n",

Whilst it might be quite difficult to learn the eigenvalues of an arbitrary group as this will require an arbitrary $n-$qubit Clifford gate (which can be a lot of primitive gates!) even today's noisy devices can quite easily create a 2-local Stabiliser group over $n-$ qubits.
